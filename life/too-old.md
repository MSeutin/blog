The short answer is no.

## Mindset

Mindset is everything. When you think you are too old to start something new, it is not your age talking - it's your mind, your thoughts, your inner voice.

I have faced moments of doubt throughout my life. At 12 I thought I was too old to start playing hockey. At 16, I believed I was wasting time in school, so I quit three years before finishing. Looking back, I laugh at those thoughts. At 31, I felt it was too late to pursue a career as a psychiatric nurse, but a few epiphanies changed my perspective.

## Bursts of hope

At 26, I discovered Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and fell in love with it. Age became irrelevant, and I trained with mostly younger peers, which kept me young in spirit. At 31, I earned a nursing license and worked in a psych ward for a decade.

## Ups and Downs

At 47, I decided I was done with feeling uneducated. I wanted to be a software engineer. Instead of taking shortcuts, I embarked on a long road toward a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, even though I didn't have high school-level math skills.

## Epiphany

Motivation and persistence fueled my journey. When doubt visited, I imagined myself 10 years from now if I quit â€“ still without a degree, skills, or a business, but 10 years older. That was enough to keep me going. Hearing about my roommate's 92-year-old mother who is still physically and mentally independent triggered a new attitude in me.

## Lifetimes

Tomorrow is uncertain for everyone. However, living as if tomorrow won't come isn't the answer. Whether you're 50 or 60, a healthy lifestyle can extend your life to 95. That's 40 more years to reinvent yourself.

Imagine the possibilities in 40 years. Doing nothing wastes time, but you could reinvent yourself twice in that span. Education might take 10 years, and success may follow.

Some people live only one life, sticking to a single path. Others live multiple lives, embracing change every 20 years. Try to change culture, learn a new language, change career or business, and make new acquaintances. You can live life to the fullest even at 70.

## Conclusion

Feeling too old can happen at any age, but it's not the age creating that feeling; it's the mindset. Whether you believe you can or believe you can't, you're right. Don't let age hold you back from experiencing what's possible. The belief that you're too old can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
